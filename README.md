These are my solutions to Advent of Code 2021.

I did better this year on not getting behind by too many days, but ultimately got
bogged down on Day 16 by trying to be too clever with the packet stream parsing.
Parser combinators are, as I've discovered, extremely powerful, but trying to learn them
in the middle of Advent of Code is a recipe for getting pretty far behind.
